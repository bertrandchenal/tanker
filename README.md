# Tanker

Tanker goal is to allow easy batch operations without compromising
database modeling. For pandas users, it's like DataFrame.to_sql on
steroids.

Currently Postgresql and Sqlite are supported. There is also optional
support for pandas DataFrames.

See the `examples` folder for a quick overview of the main features.
